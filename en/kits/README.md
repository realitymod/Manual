# **Kits** {#kits}

There are many different kits in PR:BF2. You can pick up any friendly kit that you find on the battlefield but you can't utilize enemy combatant kits. If you pick up such a kit you will be warned and will have about 30 seconds to drop the kit to avoid being killed. 15 seconds after picking up an enemy kit your screen will fade to black and at this point it will have to be dropped. Kits can be characterized into 3 main groups:

* Spawn-able: unlimited / specialized / infantry
* Request-able: unlimited / specialized / infantry
* Pick-up

**All spawn-able kits** can be obtained by selecting one on the spawn screen. **Request-able kits** can only be requested after spawning from crates or vehicles. Insurgents cannot request any kits but have access to **pick-up kits** in their bases and at weapons caches.

**Unlimited kits** can be obtained by anyone. Each request-able **specialized** infantry kit is only available to select number of players per team at the same time.

## _Kit Selection_ {#kit-selection}

**Spawn-able Unlimited kits:**

* ![](/assets/rifleman.png)The **Rifleman / Militant Warrior / Insurgent** is the standard infantry soldier of each faction. He is typically equipped with an assault rifle, grenades and smoke, depending on the faction an ammo bag.
* ![](/assets/civiicon.png)**The Civilian** is an unarmed insurgent who can assist his team with spotting enemies. Since he is a civilian there are several special rules about him, which are described in detail later in this chapter. This kit is only available to Hamas and Iraqi Insurgents. [(see The Civilian)](../the_civilian/README.md)

* ![](/assets/sapper.png)**The insurgent Sapper** sets grenade traps and places IEDs. He is vital when preparing an ambush.

**Spawn-able Special kits:**

* ![](/assets/officer.png)**The Officer / Cell Leader** kit can only be obtained by the squad leader. He is responsible for commanding his squad, communicating with the remaining team and deploying forward outposts. Detailed use of this kit is covered in the Squad Leader section.
* ![](/assets/medic.png)**The Combat Medic/Corpsman** is responsible for keeping his squad alive, which is one of the most important roles on the battlefield.

**Spawn-able Infantry:**

* ![](/assets/breacher.png)**The Rifleman Breacher / Scout** is usually the forward point man for the squad. The kit is equipped with a grappling hook to enable his squad to traverse high obstacles, a shotgun with buckshot which can be used to breach locked doors and arrest combatants. The kit is also equipped with small C4 charges to destroy various objectives within a game.
* ![](/assets/ar.png)**The Automatic Rifleman \(AR\)** soldier provides suppressive fire for the squad and is ideal for compromising the enemy's ability to move and return fire effectively.
* ![](/assets/at.png)**The Rifleman Anti-Tank \(AT\)** is a highly portable armor deterrent that has the capability of neutralizing enemy unarmored and lightly armored vehicle.
* ![](/assets/grenadier.png)**The Grenadier** uses an underbarrel grenade launcher to engage groups of hostiles or unarmored vehicles at range or inside buildings in hard to reach areas.

* ![](/assets/unarmed.png)**The Unarmed kit** can be used as an intermediary when swapping kits with another squad member. If an Insurgent or Hamas player uses the unarmed kit he will be treated as a civilian after he has dropped the kit and waited a few minutes. [(see The Civilian)](../kits/README.md#the-civilian)



**Request-able Special kits:**

* ![](/assets/hay.png)**The Anti-Tank \(HAT\)** soldier is a highly effective threat against all forms of armor and can destroy vehicles with extreme prejudice at long ranges.

**Pick-up \(insurgents\):**

* Various kits with different weapon types are available as pick up kits for the insurgent factions. These vary in almost all off the above mentioned classes.

## _Kit Request Procedure_ {#kit-request-procedure}

To request a standard, infantry or limited kit you need to meet the four requirements:

* You must be at the correct **location**
* **You must be in a squad** with enough players to request that class of kit, without it being taken already
* The requested kit must be **available** in the kit pool
* You must be **granted permission** by your Squad Leader to request the kit

**Location requirement:**

Depending on the kit type you want to request you need to be at one of the following locations:

**All request-able kits:**

* At the supply depot \(or command post\)
* At the team's supply crate or weapons cache
* At the rear of a friendly APC or IFV

**Vehicle kits:**

* At a vehicle that needs the requested kit to be operated \(Armor, Helicopter, Aircraft\)

**The unarmed kit:** {#unarmed-kit}

* Request-able anywhere
* You can't request kits while you are in a vehicle. You also can not request the unarmed kit for 15 seconds after exiting a vehicle.

To request a limited kit at the specified locations, you have to hold down the **secondary radio key \(T\)** and then select **REQUEST / DROP KIT**. This opens a sub-menu with a list of kits to choose from. If your request was granted, the new kit can be found directly at your feet, and it will tell you with an orange message:

> **“Your kit has been ALLOCATED and is at your feet”**

You need to press the **pickup key \(G\)** to take it. If your request was denied, you will see a player specific orange message explaining why you didn’t receive the kit:

> **“You need to be close to a friendly SUPPLY CRATE or APC to request this kit”**
>
> **“You need to be close to a friendly SUPPLY CRATE or VEHICLE to request this kit”**

To obtain the unarmed kit you simply need to hold down the secondary radio key, press the right mouse button to select the drop kit option.

When requesting kits from a crate or vehicle, whilst in the sub-menu you are able to right click to request the alternate kit for that class of weapon, for which there are many variants. Alternatively in the spawn menu there are also the STD and ALT buttons to switch.

**Squad requirement:**

Infantry and specialized kits have a minimum number of players in the squad as requirement before being able to select it. Use the table below to find the default values for infantry and specialized kits as well as a few exceptions to this rule. **All infantry and special kits can only be requested once in a squad except for the medic, sniper and civilian of which you can have up to 2 in each squad.**

| Kit | Minimum | Kit | Minimum |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Infantry Default** | 4 | **Machine Gunner** | 6 |
| **Special Default** | 3 | **Officer** | 2 |
| **Grenadier** | 6 | **Medic** | 2 |

It will again show you with a message when you are not fulfilling the requirement:

> **“Unavailable due to squad limitations”**

**Availability requirement:**

Infantry and special kits are drawn from a pool. The number of available kits depends on the amount of players currently on your team. The spawn-able and vehicle kits are not limited in number. If the kit is not in the following table it means it uses the default requirements for infantry and specialized kits.

| Kit | 1-7 Players | 8-15 Players | 16-23 Players | 24-31 Players | 32- 50+ Players |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Infantry Default** | 1 | 2 | 3 | 3 | 4 |
| **Special Default** | 0 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 2 |
| **HAT** | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| **Sniper** | 0 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 2 |
| **Rifleman AT** | 1 | 2 | 4 | 5 | 8 |
| **Civilian** | 1 | 3 | 9 | 12 | 16 |

When an infantry kit has been dropped and is not picked up within 5 minutes it disappears from the world and returns to the pool. Specialist kits take 10 minutes to return to the pool. It will show you an orange message if the kit in unavailable:

> **“All of these kits have been issued”**

**Allowance requirement:**

Insurgents can't request kits. The commander of a team may only request the officer kit. Certain actions temporarily prevent you from requesting kits:

* When you are issued a limited kit you will need to wait 2 minutes before you can request another one.
* If you change squads, you cannot request a kit for a further 2 minutes.
* Teamkilling someone who carries a limited kit blocks you for 3 minutes.
* If you kill a civilian violating the ROE, you will be blocked for 10 minutes.
* If you spam kit requests, you will be blocked for 30 seconds.

Not all kits are available for all factions. If you don’t have the kit available to you the game will tell you:

> **“Unavailable for your forces”**
>
> **“You can't get another limited kit so soon after your last”**
>
> **“You are new to this squad, request again in a minute”**
