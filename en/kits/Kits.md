To obtain a kit, you can:
* *Spawn with it* - The spawn menu offers 7 possible kits to choose from
* *Request it* - More information in the next section
* *Pick it up* - From wounded soldiers, caches or other specific-per-map locations

> You can only pick up friendly kits. Any attempt in using enemy kits will result in a black scren and death after a few seconds:

These kits may be limited or not. If a kit is not limited you'll be always able to spawned with or requested it from a crate, all other kits may or may not be available for you to spawn it or request it.
> In convention factions, only the rifleman, crewman and pilot kits are unlimited. All others are limited.


## Kit limitations {#kit-limitations}
For you to be able to spawn with a kit or request it, you need to meet the four requirements:
* **Location requirements**
* **Squad requirements**
* **Team requirements**
* **Miscellaneous requirements**

> Taking a kit without your squad leader permission may lead you to being kicked from the squad so make sure you always ask your squad leader which kit he needs.

### Location requirements
With the exception of the unarmed kit you don't have acess to all kits everywhere. In PR:BF2, depending on the kit you want, you need to request kits from one of these possible locations:
* At the **supply depot** (or **command post**) - All kits
* At the team's **supply crate** or **weapons cache** - All kits
* At the rear of a **friendly APC** or **IFV** - All kits
* At a vehicle that needs the requested kit to be operated \(Armor, Helicopter, Aircraft\) - Pilot or Crewman kit
* **Everywhere** - Unarmed kit

### Squad requirements
Squad requirements define the ammount of players that need to be in your squad for you to be able to request a kit and the ammount of players, in that same squad, that are allowed to have the same one (kit).

The latter requirement is easy, all squads cannot have two or more players with the same kit, with the exception of:
* **Medic** or **Sniper** - Limited to 2x per squad
* **Rifleman**, **Pilot** or **Crewman** - Unlimited
* Any **insurgent** or **pickup** kit - Unlimited

Regarding the minimum ammounts:
* 1 or more players: **Rifleman**, **Pilot**, **Crewman**, any **insurgent** kit

* 4 or more players: **Grenadier**, **Rifleman AT**, **Automatic rifleman**, **Rifleman AP**, **Breacjer**
* 6 or more players: **Marksman**, **Machine Gunner**

### Team requirements
Infantry and special kits are drawn from a pool. The number of available kits depends on the amount of players currently on your team. The spawn-able and vehicle kits are not limited in number. If the kit is not in the following table it means it uses the default requirements for infantry and specialized kits.

| Kit | 1-7 Players | 8-15 Players | 16-23 Players | 24-31 Players | 32- 50+ Players |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **HAT** | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| **Combat Engineer** | 0 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 2 |
| **Sniper** | 0 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 2 |
| **Marksman** | 1 | 2 | 3 | 3 | 4 |
| **Anti-Air** | 0 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 2 |

When an infantry kit has been dropped and is not picked up within 5 minutes it disappears from the world and returns to the pool. Specialist kits take 10 minutes to return to the pool. It will show you an orange message if the kit in unavailable:


### Miscellaneous requirements

* If you change squads, you cannot request a kit for a further 2 minutes.
* Teamkilling someone who carries a limited kit blocks you for 3 minutes.
* If you kill a civilian violating the ROE, you will be blocked for 10 minutes.
* If you spam kit requests, you will be blocked for 30 seconds.
* Some specific kits are simply not available for a given faction

## Kit Request Procedure {#kit-request-procedure}
To request a kit, you have to hold down the **secondary radio key \(T\)** and then select **REQUEST / DROP KIT**. This opens a sub-menu with a list of kits to choose from. If your request was granted, the new kit can be found directly at your feet, and it will tell you with an orange message:
> **“Your kit has been ALLOCATED and is at your feet”**

You need to press the **pickup key \(G\)** to take it.
If your request was denied, you will see a player specific orange message explaining why you didn’t receive the kit:
* If you request the kit in the wrong location, the message will be:
> **“You need to be close to a friendly SUPPLY CRATE or APC to request this kit”**
>
> **“You need to be close to a friendly SUPPLY CRATE or VEHICLE to request this kit”**
* If the failing reason is due to squad requirements, the message will be:
> **“Unavailable due to squad limitations”**
* Failing in the team requirements will cause the message to be:
> **“All of these kits have been issued”**
* Finnally failing any of the miscelanous requiment will display one of the following messages:
> **“Unavailable for your forces”**
>
> **“You can't get another limited kit so soon after your last”**
>
> **“You are new to this squad, request again in a minute”**

To obtain the unarmed kit you simply need to hold down the secondary radio key, press the right mouse button to select the drop kit option.

When requesting kits from a crate or vehicle, whilst in the sub-menu you are able to right click to request the alternate kit for that class of weapon, for which there are many variants. Alternatively in the spawn menu there are also the STD and ALT buttons to switch.
