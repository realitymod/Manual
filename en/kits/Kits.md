### Squad requirements
Squad requirements define the ammount of players that need to be in your squad for you to be able to request a kit and the ammount of players, in that same squad, that are allowed to have the same one (kit).

The latter requirement is easy, all squads cannot have two or more players with the same kit, with the exception of:

* If the failing reason is due to squad requirements, the message will be:
> **“Unavailable due to squad limitations”**
* Failing in the team requirements will cause the message to be:
> **“All of these kits have been issued”**
* Finnally failing any of the miscelanous requiment will display one of the following messages:
