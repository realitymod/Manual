## _Game Installation_                                                                          {#game-installation}

With PR:BF2 it is **no longer required to have Battlefield 2** installed. PR:BF2 works as a standalone game. If you have a version of PR:BF2 installed before v1.3 you will need to uninstall this before you install the current version PR:BF2. 

You have to download the full PR:BF2 installer from our website. There won’t be a requirement to have Battlefield 2 installed.

[**Download the latest version**](http://www.realitymod.com/downloads)

There are 2 installation methods. You can use the **Download Assistant application** which makes it a lot easier to install PR:BF2 or you can manually download and install the Installer through a **Torrent**. With either method there are 2 steps: Download and Install:

**1\) Download**

The Download Assistant will download the Installer using the Torrent protocol. So make sure this isn't blocked by your ISP. Simply download the Download Assistant from our [PR:BF2 Download Section](http://www.realitymod.com/downloads) and follow the instructions in the application. 

If you downloaded the Torrent version \(and now the Download Assistant\), this is **NOT** the full install. You use the small .torrent file with a BitTorrent client to actually download the full .iso file. We recommend [qBittorrent](http://www.qbittorrent.org/download.php). Once the torrent is downloaded through your selected Torrent software, you will be presented with a folder with all installation files, move on to step 2 after the application finishes the download.

**2\) Installation**
The downloaded folder that you now have through either the Download Assistant or the manual Torrent download now have a _setup.exe_ file. Launch this one to start the installation process. The Download Assistant however does has an automated system so after downloading there should be a button to start the installation automatically. 

A few more points:

* With the new standalone version there is also no longer a requirement to install it in the Battlefield 2 folder. Feel free to install PR:BF2 in a drive and folder of your choosing.
* If you have BF2 installed you can continue to play it and player other BF2 modifications as well. PR:BF2 does not interfere with them.
* PR:BF2 features **an auto-updater.** So once you have installed PR:BF2 you can use the updater to automatically update your game to newer versions when they are released.
* PR:BF2 includes PR Mumble in its installation. So there is no need to download this separately.
* If you don’t want to use Torrents you will find mirrors for direct HTTP downloads through our forums.

## _Creating a PR Account_ {#creating-a-pr-account}

Since DICE and EA removed support for BF2 in May 2014 we now use our own account-service for PR:BF2. All your old BF2 accounts (before PR:BF2 v1.2) are no longer retrievable. Before using the PR Launcher you will need to create a PR Account in order to play online. This account is unique to you. Offline play does not require a PR Account. We use third-party services to connect and verify a PR Account with. Currently we only support Steam. You will need to have an existing Steam account or [create a new one](https://steamcommunity.com/) in order to link to your PR Account. 
When you launch Project Reality:BF2 for the first time you will shown the following window:

{% figure "../assets/creating_profile_1.png" %}
Steam login prompt.
{% endfigure %}

Press the Steam sign-in button to open a webpage where you will need to login to Steam in order to proceed. You will be then asked by your web browser to allow the PR Launcher to login. Depending on your browser this will look similar to the images below. Press the button that allows you to proceed. Afterwards you can close the webpage. 

{% figure "../assets/creating_profile_2.png" %}
Web browsers prompts.
{% endfigure %}

Your PR Account will be assigned a PR Account Level. This level determines how much your account is deemed legitimate and not a throwaway account. Servers have the option to choose which minimum level is required to play on their server. In order to determine your PR Account Level, your Steam account will need to be made partially public. You can do this in [the Privacy Settings of Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/my/edit/settings). 
Please make sure the _game details_ settings are set to be public. 

{% figure "../assets/creating_profile_3.png" %}
Steam profile's configurations.
{% endfigure %}

**Your Steam profile does not have to be public while playing PR:BF2.** Only when calculating the PR Account level. This is done once automatically on the first login and afterwards only when manually calculating.  You can find our privacy-notice [here](https://hq.realitymod.com/account/privacy.html). If your account level is not high enough to play on most online servers you will be shown a warning on the main PR Launcher screen which looks like the image below.

{% figure "../assets/creating_profile_4.png" %}
Main Launcher page with account level warning.
{% endfigure %}

To recalculate your PR Account Level go to the **SUPPORT** menu and open the _Account_ tab. There you can find your unique PR Account ID as well as your current PR Account Level and a button to calculate it again. Your level can never become lower after calculation. You will always keep the highest level you have. 

Your PR Account Level will be higher by gathering XP for a few indicators. These are for example having no current Steam VAC bans, having games bought on the Steam store in your library and having playtime on said games. **Donations to the Project Reality team do not influence your PR Account Level.**

If you do not wish to create a PR Account to play online, you can choose to play offline only on the initial login screen. 

## _Creating a Profile_ {#creating-a-profile}

You have one PR Account that is unique. However, you can create multiple profiles under this PR Account. Each profile has a unique in-game name as well as separate settings and controls saved on your computer. You can retrieve previously created profiles as well. Older profiles created after PR:BF2 v1.2 and before v1.6 can be retrieved as well by providing the profile name and password. 

You can access the profile settings by hovering over the PLAY button in the PR Launcher and choosing _Select Profile_ and then _Manage Profiles_. You have the option to create offline profiles as well. If you didn’t log in through your online PR Account, you can only make and use offline profiles.

## _PR Mumble_                                                                                {#pr-mumble}

In game, Mumble is the program which we use to communicate to each other in PR:BF2, which replaces BF2 vanilla’s Voice-Over-IP \(VOIP\) system. The main unique feature of PR Mumble is that its primary method of communication is transmitted within 3D space, which is directional and proximity based. This is called Local. What this means is that all players on your team can talk to each other if they are nearby, and you can hear in what direction they are speaking from, similarly you can judge how far away they are, just like in real life.

After joining a squad you gain access to that squad’s Radio Net, which allows you to transmit to other players in your squad no matter where you are on the map. Squad leaders also have access to an additional Radio Net that allows them to communicate directly to the commander, globally to all other squad leaders, and directly to an individual squad leader. When using a radio net, a transmission cue will be heard when activating and deactivating the radio \(which can be activated in the launcher audio options\). The default keys for transmitting over mumble are as follows:

* **Local speech \(B or H\):** you talk to players in the 3D radius space around you.
* **Squad Radio \(V or Num 0\):** you talk to your squad, no matter where you are.
* **Squad Leader to all other squad leaders radio \(\*\):** you talk to all squad leaders at the same time. This radio net is also available to the commander to use with the same shortcut.
* **Squad Leader to specific squad leader radio \(Num 1Num 9\):** you talk to one specific squad leader in your team. These channels on the net are also available to the commander to use with the same shortcut.
* **Squad leader to Commander Radio \(/\):** you talk to the commander in private.

PR Mumble comes installed together with PR:BF2. It runs alongside the game installation and does all client side tasks automatically for you such as starting and connecting you to the right mumble-server. Players have the choice to configure their communication settings to their satisfaction just like the previous version. This includes input and output devices, volumes and the keyboard shortcuts. The two most important keys are default: Local channel \(H\) and squad radio net \(0 on the numpad\).The main keyboard shortcuts can be edited in the PR Launcher also via the options menu under the PR Mumble tab.

It’s recommended that you also check the main settings panel directly within the mumble application to make sure it’s all correctly set-up. To do this, locate the PR Dogtags in the system tray next to the Windows system clock \(PR has to be running\), click on the icon to open the mumble interface then locate settings at the top. After that the settings panel will appear and you can configure your input and output audio devices and alter more keyboard shortcuts and other settings.

PR Mumble also integrates with BF2’s HUD display. During the game you will see the names of players talking, each colour depicting over which channel they are transmitting, which is displayed in the lower left hand corner of your screen. In the lower right hand corner mumble also indicates over what channel you are transmitting with a different colour depending on the channel you are using. It also shows whether your microphone or speakers are muted, and if there’s linking issues with the mumble client.

## _Troubleshooting_ {#troubleshooting}

* PR:BF2 has its own file verification before you start the game. You will not be able to play online with modified files. You can still use them offline.
* PR:BF2 needs to be started using the PR Launcher. Launching BF2.EXE or PRBF2.EXE will not work.
* In addition to the built-in server browser you can use the web-based [PRSpy](http://realitymodfiles.com/geze/prspy/) to browse and join PR:BF2 servers. PRSpy also features a friend-list which makes locating your friends much easier.

Direct link link to PRSpy : [http://www.realitymod.com/prspy/](http://www.realitymod.com/prspy/)

* If the server you want to join is full you now have the option of using Auto Deploy. Select the server, click on “SERVER INFO” and then “AUTO DEPLOY”. A dialog will open that explains the remaining steps. Then simply sit back and wait to be connected once a slot opens up.
* The Support Menu in the PR Launcher can come in very handy. It can gather all system information of your computer for you to copy and paste into our Support forums for when you need assistance. It can also provide you with your CD-Key Hash.
