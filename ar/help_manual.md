# Contributing guide
The Project Reality manual is a great document for both new players and old timers coming back. 
To make it easier for them we try to make it updated with the latest changes and accessible in as many languages as possible and for this we need your help!

If you spot any issue, wish to expand the manual more or want to translate to a different language you're welcome to submit an issue and/or create a pull request with the intended changes.

Our manual uses [Markdown syntax](#syntax), a very easy to learn system, where it basically free text with a few options for formatting.
Additionally, we serve the manual using HonKit, a fork of GitBook.

## Translating
In order for you to work on your version of the manual, you will need to create your own copy, a Git Fork. 
Simply go to our GitHub page and click Fork button in the top right corner.

This will now create a copy fork of our Manual on your GitHub profile for you to work on. You can also then invite other users to help you by inviting them to the fork repo.

Once you have your fork installed on your computer, we suggest you copy the 'en' folder and change the name to the 2 letter language code that you are translating into. Then you open this new folder and in each subfolder you will find README.md files. These are the chapters and therefore the files that will need translating.

{% note %}
The changelog in README.md, is dedicated to each languange, don't translate it.
Instead, simply add an entry and describe what was added/removed/changed/translated.
{% endnote %}

You will also find the SUMMARY.md which is the page table. This one will also require translation of the titles. Note that there are many links (ex. {#subchapter-name}) in the files. These are used to link to chapters within the document. It's recommended not to change these names so all the links continue to work. Also don't translate and actual folder names. Also don't change any image names.

Please in the meantime let us know you are working on a translation so we can take a look and potentially help out. 

## Syntax
### Headings
To create a heading, add one to six # symbols before your heading text. The number of # you use will determine the size of the heading.

```markdown
# This is an <h1> tag
## This is an <h2> tag
###### This is an <h6> tag
```

The sidebar, on the right, is automatically filled with the header 2 and 3 present in the page.

### Paragraphs and Line Breaks {#paragraphs}

A paragraph is simply one or more consecutive lines of text, separated by one or more blank lines. (A blank line is any line that looks like a blank line — a line containing nothing but spaces or tabs is considered blank.) Normal paragraphs should not be indented with spaces or tabs.

```
Here's a line for us to start with.

This line is separated from the one above by two newlines, so it will be a *separate paragraph*.
```

### Emphasis {#emphasis}

```markdown
*This text will be italic*
_This will also be italic_

**This text will be bold**
__This will also be bold__

~~This text will be crossed out.~~

_You **can** combine them_
```

### Lists {#lists}

Markdown supports ordered (numbered) and unordered (bulleted) lists.

##### Unordered

Unordered lists use asterisks, pluses, and hyphens — interchangably — as list markers:

```markdown
* Item 1
* Item 2
  * Item 2a
  * Item 2b
```

##### Ordered

Ordered lists use numbers followed by periods:

```markdown
1. Item 1
2. Item 2
3. Item 3
   * Item 3a
   * Item 3b
```

### Links {#links}

Markdown supports two style of links: inline and reference.

A simple link can be created by surrounding the text with square brackets and the link URL with parentheses:

```markdown
This is [an example](http://example.com/ "Title") inline link with a title.

[This link](http://example.net/) has no title attribute.
```

Links can point to relative paths, anchors or absolute urls.


### References

There is another way to create links which does not interrupt the text flow. The URL and title are defined using a reference name and this reference name is then used in square brackets instead of the link URL:

```markdown
This is [an example][id] reference-style link.
```

Then, anywhere in the document, you define your link label like this, on a line by itself:

```markdown
[id]: http://example.com/  "Optional Title Here"
```

### Images {#images}

Images can be created in a similar way than links: just use an exclamation mark before the square brackets. The link text will become the alternative text of the image and the link URL specifies the image source:

```markdown
An image: ![gras](img/image.jpg)
```

### Figures

Figures are, essecially, centered images with a caption.

```
{% figure "../path/to/image.jpg" %}
Image's caption
{% endfigure %}
```

You can also define multiple images for the same figure.
```
{% figure "img_1.jpg", "img_2.jpg", "img_3.jpg" %}
Image's caption
{% endfigure %}
```


### Blockquotes {#blockquotes}

A blockquote is started using the `>` marker followed by an optional space; all following lines that are also started with the blockquote marker belong to the blockquote. You can use any block-level elements inside a blockquote:

```markdown
As Kanye West said:

> We're living the future so
> the present is our past.
```

### Notes

Notes are the small highlights that give quick information
Warning: Markdown is not parsed inside this tag.

```
{% note %}
This would be a note.
{% endnote %}
```


### Youtube

If you wish to embed a youtube video, you just need to grab its ID and place it between `()` tags.

```
{{ "Custom Youtube's title" | youtube("xxxxxxxxx") }}
```


### Tables {#tables}

You can create tables by assembling a list of words and dividing them with hyphens `-` (for the first row), and then separating each column with a pipe `|`:

```markdown
| First Header  | Second Header |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Content Cell  | Content Cell  |
| Content Cell  | Content Cell  |
```

The pipes on either end of the table are optional. Cells can vary in width and do not need to be perfectly aligned within columns. There must be at least three hyphens in each column of the header row.

### Code {#code}

Markdown supports two different code block styles. One uses lines indented with either four spaces or one tab whereas the other uses lines with tilde characters as delimiters – therefore the content does not need to be indented:

```markdown
This is a sample code block.

    Continued here.

```

##### Fenced code blocks

You can create fenced code blocks by placing triple backticks ` ``` ` before and after the code block. We recommend placing a blank line before and after code blocks to make the raw formatting easier to read.

    ```
    function test() {
      console.log("notice the blank line before this function?");
    }
    ```

##### Syntax highlighting

You can add an optional language identifier to enable syntax highlighting in your fenced code block.

For example, to syntax highlight Ruby code:

    ```ruby
    require 'redcarpet'
    markdown = Redcarpet.new("Hello World!")
    puts markdown.to_html
    ```

##### Inline code

Text phrases can be marked up as code by surrounding them with backticks:

    Use `honkit` to convert the `text` in markdown
    syntax to HTML.

### Footnotes

HonKit supports a simple syntax for such footnotes. Footnotes are relative to each pages.

```markdown
Text prior to footnote reference.[^2]

[^2]: Comment to include in footnote.
```

### HTML

HonKit supports use of raw HTML in your text, Markdown syntax in HTML is not processed:

```
<div>
Markdown here will not be **parsed**
</div>
```

### Horizontal Rule

Horizontal Rules can be inserted using three or more asterisks, dashes or underscores, optionally separated by spaces or tabs, on an otherwise blank line:

```markdown
Three or more...

---

Hyphens

***

Asterisks

```

### Ignoring Markdown formatting

You can tell HonKit to ignore (or escape) Markdown formatting by using `\` before the Markdown character.

```
Let's rename \*our-new-project\* to \*our-old-project\*.
```
